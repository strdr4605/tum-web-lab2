# Lab 4 - CSS Libraries/Frameworks

The client wants to simplify and streamline the process of styling and designing their landing page. 
So they think adding a CSS library/framework will make the development more rapid and consistent.

## Customer requirements

- Make a POC (Proof of Concept) of a CSS framework integration into the landing page from the last labs.
- Choose any of the modern CSS frameworks (for example: Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, SemanticUI, ...) and change 2 sections of the landing page:
  - Use layout class helpers (for example: display in columns/rows, hide elements, ...)
  - Use some colors and styles from the CSS framework (for example: Background colors, Hover colors, ...)
 
## Dev requirements

- The POC should be done during lab class.
- The POC with CSS framework should be deployed live, for the customer to test it.
