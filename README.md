In this laboratory session, we focused on developing a basic front-end landing page for a website. The main objectives of this task were:

- Gain familiarity with HTML5 structure and syntax.
- Learn fundamental CSS styling techniques.
- Understand the process of creating a responsive layout.
- Apply best practices for organizing code and files.

## Task Details

### Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap

### Task Requirements
1. Design a visually appealing landing page.
2. Utilize semantic HTML tags for structuring the content.
3. Apply CSS to style various elements of the page.
4. Ensure responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.

### Deliverables
- HTML file(s) containing the structure of the landing page.
- CSS file(s) for styling the page.
- Any additional assets used in the project (images, fonts, etc.).

## Dev requirements (lab3)

- Use vanilla CSS and HTML (no frameworks)
- Have a decent git history (no one commit)
- The page with mascot and responsive design should be deployed on a live link

## Dev requirements (lab4)

- Use vanilla CSS and HTML (no frameworks)
- Have a decent git history (no one commit)
- The page should be deployed on a free hosting service (example: GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify)
- Project repo should have a README with a short description of the landing page topic, screenshots, and a link to the live demo


- The POC should be done during lab class.
- The POC with CSS framework should be deployed live, for the customer to test it.


## Customer requirements (lab 3)

- Some of our clients view the landing page on mobile devices (please make the landing page responsive)
  - All elements' sizes should be adjusted for desktop/mobile view. `3 Points`
  - Call to action should be visible on mobile `1 Point`
  - There should be mobile-only elements (example: a section, a title, an image) `1 Point`
    
- We need a mascot for our page similar to Microsoft Clippy, the mascot should:
  - be related to the topic of the landing page `0.4 Points`
  - be friendly/pleasant to the eyes (can be an image or an SVG) `1 Point`
  - appear on the page after some delay on corners or borders of the page `1 Point`
  - be animated (rotating, tilting, jumping, walking) `1.4 Points`
  - display a welcome/CTA/info message when hovering with the mouse `1 Point`
